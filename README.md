### [Futures Trading System For Fixed Income Derivatives](https://github.com/s1dewalker/Futures-trading)
A glimpse of the system that was used @ Futures First. This system utilized data analytics, quantitative analysis, and account management. It involved keeping an eagle eye on fixed income products w/ live Excel dashboards. Being prepared for a range of outcomes w/ risk scenario analysis. Changing the game w/ performance analysis, financial metrics, and stats. Applied ML and probability models to identify and predict market states, optimizing portfolio and risk assessment. Providing defense to account management w/ a resilient capital allocation system. <br/>
